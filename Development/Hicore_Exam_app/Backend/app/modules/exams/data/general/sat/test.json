Wait. Let's use property. $a^2 = b(b+c)$? No. Let's re-calculate: $\\cos B = 5/8$. From law of cosines: $4^2 = 5^2 + c^2 - 2(5)c(5/8) \\implies 16 = 25 + c^2 - 6.25c \\implies c^2 - 6.25c + 9 = 0$. $c = [6.25 \\pm \\sqrt{39.0625 - 36}]/2 = [6.25 \\pm 1.75]/2$. $c = 4$ or $2.25$. Since $C = 180-3B$, and $B$ is about 51.3, $C$ is small, so $c$ is likely $2.25$. Let me re-check options. 4.1? Maybe $c=4.1$ is for different ratio."
