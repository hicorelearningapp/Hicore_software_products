For a company producing a product, the profit function π(q) = R(q) - C(q) (revenue minus cost) can be analyzed to find the production level q that maximizes profit. The first-order condition requires setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost (R'(q) = C'(q)), and the second-order condition ensures this is a maximum (R''(q) < C''(q)). Similarly, cost minimization involves finding the input combination that produces a given output at the lowest cost, often using constrained optimization techniques. These applications are fundamental in managerial economics and operations research."

The distribution of Y can be found using the CDF method: F_Y(y) = P(Y ≤ y) = P(g(X) ≤ y), then differentiate to get f_Y(y). For monotonic g, if X has PDF f_X(x), then Y = g(X) has PDF f_Y(y) = f_X(g⁻¹(y))⋅|d/dy g⁻¹(y)|.",
                "The moment generating function (MGF) M_X(t) = E[e^(tX)] uniquely determines the distribution of X if it exists in a neighborhood of zero. MGFs are useful for finding moments (E[Xⁿ] = M_X⁽ⁿ⁾(0)) and for proving that sums of independent random variables have MGFs that are products of individual MGFs. The characteristic function φ_X(t) = E[e^(itX)] always exists and also uniquely determines the distribution.",
                "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed (iid) random variables with finite mean μ and variance σ² is approximately normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ²/n, where n is the number of variables. This fundamental result explains the prevalence of the normal distribution in nature and is the basis for many statistical methods.",
                "Joint distributions describe the behavior of multiple random variables. For discrete (X,Y), the joint PMF is p(x,y) = P(X=x, Y=y). For continuous (X,Y), the joint PDF f(x,y) satisfies P((X,Y) ∈ A) = ∬_A f(x,y)dxdy. Marginal distributions are obtained by summing/integrating out the other variables. Conditional distributions are defined as f_{Y|X}(y|x) = f_{X,Y}(x,y)/f_X(x). Random variables are independent if f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)⋅f_Y(y) for all x,y."

The log-normal distribution is often used for stock prices because prices cannot be negative and the returns (logarithm of price ratios) are often normally distributed. Value at Risk (VaR) uses probability distributions to estimate potential losses in investments. For example, if a portfolio's daily returns are normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the 1-day 95% VaR is approximately μ - 1.645σ. Options pricing models like Black-Scholes use stochastic processes based on random variables to determine fair prices for financial derivatives, accounting for the random nature of market movements."

The normal distribution describes variations in product dimensions due to inherent process variability. Control charts track whether a manufacturing process is in statistical control by monitoring if sample statistics fall within expected ranges based on probability distributions. The Weibull distribution models the lifetime of products and helps in reliability analysis. For example, if light bulb lifetimes follow an exponential distribution with mean 1000 hours, the probability that a bulb lasts more than 2000 hours is e^(-2000/1000) ≈ 0.135. This helps manufacturers set warranty periods and improve product reliability."

The Poisson process models the number of phone calls arriving at a call center, where the time between arrivals follows an exponential distribution. Queueing theory uses probability distributions to analyze waiting times and optimize resource allocation. For instance, if calls arrive at a rate of λ per minute and service times are exponential with mean 1/μ, the system is stable if λ < μ, and the average number of calls in the system is λ/(μ-λ). This analysis helps in designing networks with sufficient capacity to handle traffic while maintaining acceptable service levels."
